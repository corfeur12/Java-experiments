# Java-experiments
A whole bunch of Java experiments

## All Experiments

### Finished Experiments

### WIP

* Mandelbrot explorer
* Sorting algorithms

### Experiment Ideas

* Julia set explorer
* Tree/trie generator/explorers
* Graphs (abstractions for the use of Dijkstra's algorithm etc.)
* Hash tables
* Encryption

## About these

### Mandelbrot explorer:

A GUI based program to render the Mandelbrot set and to enable user exploration.

### Sorting algorithms:

Various sorting algorithm implementations. These are generally not too efficient but are made as a practical application of various algorithms.
